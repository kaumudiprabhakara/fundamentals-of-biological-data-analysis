Includes brain and body weight, life span, gestation time, time
sleeping, and predation and danger indices for 62 mammals.

Variables below for Mammals Data Set:

    species of animal
    body weight in kg
    brain weight in g
    slow wave ("nondreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
    paradoxical ("dreaming") sleep (hrs/day)
    total sleep (hrs/day) (sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep)
    maximum life span (years)
    gestation time (days)
    predation index (1-5)
    - 1 = minimum (least likely to be preyed upon)
    - 5 = maximum (most likely to be preyed upon)
    sleep exposure index (1-5)
    - 1 = least exposed (e.g. animal sleeps in a
    well-protected den)
    - 5 = most exposed
    overall danger index (1-5)
    (based on the above two indices and other information)
    - 1 = least danger (from other animals)
    - 5 = most danger (from other animals)

Note: Missing values denoted by -999.0
