    Species: Bird species name
    Family: Family of birds to which this species belongs
    Heterozygosity: A measure of genetic richness. Birds (and most animals) have two copies of each chromosome; expected heterozygosity is the probability that for a randomly selected gene, these two copies will be different versions (alleles) of the gene.
    Allelic richness: The average number of different alleles (versions of a gene) for each gene.
    Breeding range size: Size of the spatial range over which this bird breeds, in units of 10,000 square km
    Body mass: Average body mass of the species (grams)
    Latitude: Mid-point latitude of the species breeding range. (All latitudes are positive, even those in the southern hemisphere.)
    Migratory status: Is this species migratory or does it stay resident in one area?
