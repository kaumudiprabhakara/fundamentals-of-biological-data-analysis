Introduction: Distance-based Decision-Making in Oviposition by Tribolium castaneum Herbst on Low and No Gluten Flours

This study investigates the oviposition (egg-laying) preferences of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, on 14 commercially available flours, focusing on low and no gluten varieties. While these beetles are known to infest wheat flour, their behaviour with alternative flours has been less understood. Using three experimental assays, the researchers analysed egg-laying tendencies and the potential influence of flour volatiles and texture on the beetles' choices. link
Dataset Resources:

    Eggs laid in the large arena:
        Includes egg counts for wheat and alternative flours, spatial positions, and chamber conditions.
    Eggs laid in the small arena:
        Focuses on treatment-based comparisons between wheat and alternative flours.
    Wind tunnel preference tests:
        Captures movement data of beetles in response to flour volatiles.

Egg-laying preferences:

    High egg-laying: Buckwheat, teff, millet, rice, and rye flours were preferred, similar to wheat.
    Low egg-laying: Sorghum, potato, quinoa, cassava, oat, amaranth, garbanzo, spelt, and corn flours showed significantly reduced oviposition rates.


Assay insights:

    Small Arena (Choice Assay):
        Size: 90-mm Petri dish.
        Setup: Single female beetle, 48-hour duration.
        Results: Focused testing of individual behaviour supported the broad findings of the large arena while reducing variability due to group interactions.
    Large Arena (Choice Assay):
        Size: 45.7 × 55 × 8.9 cm.
        Setup: 20 mixed-sex adults, 4-day duration.
        Results: Egg counts indicated positional and environmental factors could influence preferences but broadly confirmed trends from the smaller arena.
    Wind Tunnel (Preference Assay):
        Airflow: 0.45–0.53 m/s.
        Setup: Individual beetles tested for upwind movement toward flour volatiles.
        Results: Highlighted the role of flour volatiles, with beetles moving towards preferred flours more often, aligning with oviposition preferences.
