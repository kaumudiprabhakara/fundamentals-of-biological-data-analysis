The dataset consists of 1,000 protein entries, each characterized by the following attributes:

    ID: A unique identifier for each protein entry.
    Name: The name of the protein.
    Sequence: The amino acid sequence of the protein, which is fundamental for determining its structure and function.
    Molecular Weight: The calculated molecular weight of the protein in Daltons (Da), crucial for understanding the protein’s size and how it interacts with other molecules.
    Isoelectric Point (pI): The pH at which the protein carries no net electric charge, influencing its solubility and interaction with other molecules.
    Protein Length: The number of amino acids in the protein sequence, indicating the protein’s size and potential complexity.
    Amino Acid Composition: The frequency or percentage of each amino acid within the protein sequence, offering insights into the protein’s structural properties and functional roles.
    Hydrophobicity: A measure of the protein's hydrophobic (water-repelling) properties, which plays a critical role in protein folding, stability, and interactions with other biomolecules.It is calculated by Kyte-Doolittle scale.
