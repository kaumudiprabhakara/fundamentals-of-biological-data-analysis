# Fundamentals of Biological Data Analysis
This is a mini-course on the fundamental concepts of biological data analysis. Information about the course, intended audience, prerequisites, registration and other logistics can be found here. Additional course materials will be uploaded here during the course. 

**Instructors: Dr. Kaumudi Prabhakara, Gisela T Rodríguez-Sánchez, Manuela Reuter**

Intended audience 
----------------------

This course is aimed at those who want to (1) understand the mathematics behind data analysis functions and (2) start writing their own code to analyze data. Mathematics and writing codes will be big components of the course. We start from a fundamental level, only assuming that the participants have basic programming skills (see Prerequisites below). 


Course description 
----------------------

This hands-on course will delve into the fundamental concepts of analyzing biological data. The participants will learn what commonly used analysis tools actually do, and when and how they can be used. The participants will also learn to write their own codes to analyse data. 

  - **Day 1:** Statistics, including probabilities, distributions, hypothesis testing, correlations
     - Datasets for T-test: [Iris](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/iris.csv)
     - Datasets for Correlations: [Trees](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/trees.csv)
  - **Day 2:** Regressions, including LASSO regularization, and ANOVA
     - Datasets for Regression: [Rice](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/rice_dataset.csv) and [Leukemia](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/standardized_leukemia_data.csv)
  - **Day 3:** Linear models
  - **Day 4:** Principal Component Analysis
      - Dataset for PCA: [Wines](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/wine_dataset.csv)
  - **Day 5:** Fitting bacterial growth models to data
      - Dataset for fitting [growth models](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/growth.csv). 

Prerequisites  
----------------------

Basic programming skills are necessary. The course instructors will use either Python or R. 
To ensure you have the minimum skills necessary for the course, we have created a set of tasks. If you can write programs to perform these tasks, then you have the skills necessary to participate in the course. The list of tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/Prereq_tasks.pdf). Check your answers [here](https://github.com/kaumudiprabhakara/fundamentals-of-biological-data-analysis/blob/main/Prerequisite_tasks_answers.pdf). 

If you cannot complete these tasks, but are willing to learn, we are happy to help you **before the course starts.** You are welcome to contact us to help you get started and complete the tasks, so that you are ready by the time the course begins.
For help with R, contact: Gisela Rodriguez (rodriguez@evolbio.mpg.de) or Manuela Reuter (mreuter@evolbio.mpg.de)
For help with Python, contact: Dr. Kaumudi Prabhakara (prabhakara@evolbio.mpg.de)


Logistics  
----------------------
  - The course will run from January 13 - 17, 2025.
  - **Register [here](https://survey.academiccloud.de/index.php/773252?newtest=Y&lang=en)**
  - The course will take place in the "Practical Room" in the "interim building" (the building in front of the main building, and next to the parking lot) of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. 
  - There is no registration fee. 
  - You are expected to bring your own laptops. If this is difficult, please contact us as early as possible, so that we can try to organize a computer for you. 
  - The course will start at 09:00 and end at 17:00. There will be three breaks - one longer lunch break and two shorter breaks. 
  - The course will be in English.
  - Due to space constraints, the course is limited to 15 participants. 

Code of Conduct
----------------------
The course is a safe space for learning. We encourage the following behaviour:
   - Use welcoming and inclusive language
   - Be respectful of different experiences
   - Provide and accept constructive criticism gracefully
   - Show courtesy and respect towards others
